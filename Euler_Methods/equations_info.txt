Note when entering equations:
    Exponential functions should be specified in the form exp([remainder of the expression]).
    Roots must be expressed as fractional exponents.
    Exponents are expressed using the ** symbol, not ^.
    If you wish to validate the equations shown in the practical part of the guide, consider that they follow a format:
        exp(2*y)
        (x+y-2)**2
        0.9y - 1.8y**2
